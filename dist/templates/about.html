        <p>Hitz, formed in 1981 touring around the country, opening and sometimes backing 50's and 60's national recording artists such as Paul Revere & the Raiders, The Coasters, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Jan & Dean and about two dozen others, too numerous to mention.  They also did a comedy and tribute show of their own, but always maintained the formula of playing the "greatest hits of all time".</p></br>

        <p>Kent has called Minnesota home for most of his life, but has traveled extensively in his career as a founder and leader of several well known regional and national touring acts such as Kaleidoscope, Gangbusters and then forming Hitz in 1981.  Many of his band mates formed popular offshoot groups and his experiences of playing with, or opening for, a huge list of who's who rock and roll artists has taken him all over the country and several cruises. </p></br>

        <p>Kent's excellent guitar playing and clear soaring voice singing favorites like Roy Orbison, Frankie Valli and the Bee Gees have impressed crowds for decades.  His impressions of famous artists, serious and comedic, show that he is a real entertainer.</p>
